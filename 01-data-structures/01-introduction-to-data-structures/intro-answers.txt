1. Line
  a. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
    It stores data in an array, and uses helper methods to access and manipulate the data stored in the array.

  b. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
    Since this is an unsorted list, linear search is used to iterate through each item in the array until a
    specific element is found.  If none is found, nil is returned.

  c. What other real-world data can each structure represent?
    This could be used for products on a store shelf, such as milk.  New items (freshest milk) is added to the back
    so the oldest milk stays in front.  But any milk carton could be removed or added, and the remaining cartons would move up.

2. Screen
  a. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
    It stores data in a multidimensional array (i.e. matrix) that is initialized with values of nil at each location.  To access and manipulate
    the data, helper methods are defined to change or return info about the matrix.

  b. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
    Just the x and y coordinates are needed to find the pixel at a given location.

  c. What other real-world data can each structure represent?
    This could be used for 2D maps to store additional information about a given lat/long location, such as elevation,
    temperature, etc.
